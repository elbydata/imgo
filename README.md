# IMGO

## Compile, Process, and Augment Image Data

This library is designed to facilitate the preprocessing phase of image classification projects. 

### Features:

Imgo is composed of two distinct but related modules: **Uptools** and **Augtools**.

**Uptools** helps to streamline various image data preprocessing tasks, such as:

 - Reading images from a local disk
 - Rescaling images
 - Normalizing and standardizing pixel values
 - Converting image datasets into numpy-arrays
 - One-hot-encoding label data
 - Splitting image datasets into training, validation, and testing subsets
 - Merging data subsets into single dataset
 - Saving numpy-arrays as images in class subdirectories
 
**Augtools** allows the user to quickly and efficiently apply augmentation to image data. With Augtools, users can perform the following augmentation tasks using very few lines of code:

 - Apply a small but powerful collection of transformation and corruption functions
 - Augment images saved on a local disk
 - Save augmented images in class subdirectories
 - Augment entire image datasets
 - Augment training data in place in preparation for machine learning projects
 
Here is a sample image augmented using Imgo:
